        <!-- First paragraph about organizing competitions -->
        <p>
            To further support the community in helping aspiring artists find a place to start their career, we also want to organize competitions where aspiring artists can perform and compete.

        <!-- Second paragraph about benefits and feedback from competitions -->
        <p>
            These competitions can build the confidence of artists as they are performing to audiences and judges. Through these competitions, experts and the audience can provide feedback to the artist, which allows them to improve and try again the next time we organize a competition. Winners of this competition can get the opportunity to work with us.
